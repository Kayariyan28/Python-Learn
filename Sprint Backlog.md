# Python Journey: Module 1 - Sprint Backlog

This document helps you track your learning using agile project management principles. By organizing your learning into "sprints" (1-2 week periods), you can better plan, execute, and reflect on your progress.

## How to Use This Backlog

For each user story:
1. Move it from "To Learn" to "In Progress" when you start working on it
2. Move it to "Completed" when you've finished the associated notebook, exercises, and feel confident in your understanding
3. Track your progress through regular "sprint reviews" and "retrospectives"

Each learning concept is framed as a "user story" - a description of a feature told from your perspective as a learner.
