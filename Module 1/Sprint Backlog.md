SPRINT BACKLOG - MODULE 1: PYTHON FOUNDATIONS

How to use this file:
1. For each concept, move it from the "To Learn" section to "In Progress" when you start
2. Move it to "Completed" once you've finished the associated notebook & exercises
3. Add notes or questions in the comments beside each item
4. Review your progress at the end of each week

You can track this using:
- Comments in this file (changing # TO LEARN to # IN PROGRESS to # COMPLETED)
- A physical board with sticky notes
