# Python Journey: Sprint Board Template

This template helps you track your learning progress using an agile project management approach. By organizing your learning into "sprints" (1-2 week periods), you can better plan, execute, and reflect on your progress.

## How to Use This Board

1. **Copy this template** for each learning sprint (typically 1-2 weeks)
2. **Move tasks** from "To Learn" to "In Progress" to "Mastered" as you work through them
3. **Update the board daily** during your learning sessions
4. **Conduct a retrospective** at the end of each sprint

You can use this template:
- In a text file (update manually)
- In a markdown editor like Typora or VS Code
- On a digital kanban board like Trello or GitHub Projects
- On a physical board with sticky notes

## Sprint Retrospective

### What went well
- Setting aside specific time blocks for learning worked well
- Taking notes while watching tutorial videos helped retention
- Typing out all examples instead of copy-pasting reinforced learning

### What could be improved
- I underestimated how long it would take to understand some concepts
- I got distracted by trying to learn additional concepts not in my plan
- I didn't practice enough with exercises

### Actions for next sprint
- Plan for 25% fewer points to account for learning curve
- Focus only on the planned learning items
- Include more practice exercises in my learning plan
- Find a study buddy for the more complex topics
