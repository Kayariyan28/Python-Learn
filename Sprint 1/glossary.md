Python Journey: Glossary of Terms
This glossary provides definitions for common Python terms and concepts covered in Module 1. Use it as a reference when you encounter unfamiliar terminology.
A
Argument
A value passed to a function when calling it. For example, in print("Hello"), the string "Hello" is an argument.
Assignment
The process of giving a value to a variable using the = operator. For example: x = 10 assigns the value 10 to the variable x.
Assignment Operator
Operators used to assign values to variables. The basic assignment operator is =, but there are also compound operators like +=, -=, *=, etc.
B
Boolean
A data type that can only have one of two values: True or False. Used in conditions and logical operations.
Break Statement
A statement used to exit a loop prematurely. When break is encountered in a loop, execution immediately jumps out of the loop.
Built-in Function
A function that comes with Python and is always available without needing to import additional modules. Examples include print(), len(), type(), etc.
C
Comment
Text in a program that is ignored by the Python interpreter. Used to explain code or temporarily disable code execution. Single-line comments start with #, while multi-line comments are enclosed in triple quotes (""" or ''').
Comparison Operator
Operators used to compare values: == (equal), != (not equal), < (less than), > (greater than), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to).
Concatenation
The operation of joining strings together using the + operator. For example: "Hello" + " " + "World" results in "Hello World".
Condition
An expression that evaluates to either True or False. Used in control flow statements like if, elif, while, etc.
Continue Statement
A statement used to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.
Control Flow
The order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed. Common control flow statements include if, for, while, break, continue, etc.
D
Data Type
A classification of data that determines what values it can have and what operations can be performed on it. Common data types in Python include integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, etc.
Default Parameter
A parameter in a function definition that is given a default value, which is used if the corresponding argument is not provided when the function is called.
Dictionary
A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. Defined using curly braces {} with key-value pairs separated by colons. For example: {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}.
Docstring
A string literal that appears as the first statement in a function, class, or module. Used to document what the function, class, or module does. Enclosed in triple quotes (""" or ''').
E
Element
An individual item in a list or other collection. For example, in the list [1, 2, 3], the elements are 1, 2, and 3.
Exception
An error detected during program execution. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of the program is interrupted.
Expression
A combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that produces a value. For example: 2 + 3 * 4 is an expression that evaluates to 14.
F
Float
A data type representing decimal numbers. For example: 3.14, 2.71828, -0.5.
For Loop
A loop that iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or any iterable object. For example: for i in range(5): will execute the following code block 5 times.
Function
A reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Can accept inputs (parameters) and return outputs.
G
Global Variable
A variable defined at the module level, outside of any function. It can be accessed from anywhere in the module.
I
Identifier
A name given to entities like variables, functions, classes, etc. Must follow naming rules (start with a letter or underscore, followed by letters, numbers, or underscores).
if Statement
A control flow statement that executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
if-elif-else Statement
A chain of conditional statements that checks multiple conditions in sequence.
Immutable
An object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. Immutable types in Python include integers, floats, strings, tuples, and frozensets.
Indentation
Whitespace at the beginning of a line, used to determine the grouping of statements. Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, unlike many other languages that use braces {}.
Index
An integer value used to access a specific element in a sequence. In Python, indices start at 0. For example, in the string "Python", the character at index 0 is 'P'.
Input Function
The input() function used to accept user input from the console.
Integer
A data type representing whole numbers without decimal points. For example: 1, -5, 1000.
Iterable
An object capable of returning its elements one at a time. Examples include lists, strings, dictionaries, and file objects.
Iteration
The process of repeatedly executing a block of code, typically in a loop.
K
Keyword
A reserved word in Python that has a special meaning and cannot be used as an identifier. Examples include if, for, while, def, class, etc.
Keyword Argument
An argument passed to a function using the parameter name. For example: print(end="") uses the keyword argument end.
L
Lambda Function
An anonymous function (a function without a name) defined using the lambda keyword.
List
An ordered, mutable collection of elements. Defined using square brackets []. For example: [1, 2, 3, 4].
List Comprehension
A concise way to create lists based on existing lists or other iterables. For example: [x**2 for x in range(5)] creates the list [0, 1, 4, 9, 16].
Local Variable
A variable defined within a function and only accessible within that function.
Logical Operator
Operators used to combine conditional statements: and, or, not.
Loop
A control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition or for each item in a collection.
M
Method
A function that is associated with an object. Called using the dot notation, like my_list.append(5) or my_string.upper().
Module
A file containing Python code that can be imported and used in other Python files.
Mutable
An object whose state can be modified after it is created. Mutable types in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets.
N
Nested List
A list that contains other lists as elements. Used to represent multi-dimensional data like matrices.
Nested Loop
A loop inside another loop. The inner loop is executed completely for each iteration of the outer loop.
None
A special constant in Python that represents the absence of a value or a null value.
O
Operator
A symbol that performs an operation on one or more operands. Examples include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, <, >), etc.
P
Parameter
A variable in a function definition. When the function is called, the arguments are assigned to the parameters.
Pass Statement
A null statement that does nothing. Used as a placeholder where a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed.
PEP 8
The style guide for Python code that provides conventions for writing clean, readable code.
Print Function
The print() function used to display output to the console.
R
Range Function
The range() function used to generate a sequence of numbers, commonly used in for loops.
Return Statement
A statement used to exit a function and optionally return a value.
S
Scope
The region of a program where a variable is visible and accessible.
Sequence
An ordered collection of items that can be indexed and sliced. Examples include strings, lists, and tuples.
Slicing
Extracting a portion of a sequence. For example: my_list[1:4] extracts elements at indices 1, 2, and 3.
String
A sequence of characters, enclosed in single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or triple quotes (''' or """).
String Formatting
Various ways to embed expressions inside string literals, like f-strings, the format() method, or the % operator.
Syntax
The set of rules that define how a Python program should be written for it to be valid.
T
Triple Quotes
Three consecutive single or double quotes used to create multi-line strings or docstrings.
Tuple
An ordered, immutable collection of elements. Defined using parentheses (). For example: (1, 2, 3).
Type Conversion (Casting)
Converting a value from one data type to another. For example: int("42") converts the string "42" to the integer 42.
Type Function
The type() function used to determine the data type of a value or variable.
V
Variable
A named location in memory used to store a value. Variables in Python don't need explicit declaration before use.
W
While Loop
A loop that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
Whitespace
Spaces, tabs, and newlines in code. In Python, whitespace is significant, particularly for indentation.
Z
Zero-Based Indexing
The convention where the first element of a sequence has an index of 0, not 1. Python uses zero-based indexing for sequences like strings, lists, and tuples.
